## Installation ðŸ”§ ðŸ”¨

## Installation Scripts

`Clone the repository`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClaudioRSGit/BlogASP.git
```

`Update Database`
```bash
update-database
```


### Code First Methodology
Our software employs the "Code First" methodology in database design. This approach involves defining the data model using C# classes, referred to as entities. The database schema is then automatically generated based on these classes when the application runs for the first time. This streamlines the process of database creation and management.
 
### Database Context and DbSet
In our application, the Database Context serves as the bridge between the application and the database, our DAL. It's represented by the DatabaseContext class derived from DbContext. DbSet, on the other hand, represents a collection of entities in the context, corresponding to a table in the database. We use DbSet to query and manipulate data.

## Usage

### Lets say that you're the Administrator

`login system`
